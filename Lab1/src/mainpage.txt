/*! \mainpage Lab1 - Computational complexity for dynamic table assignment
	
	A framework for benchmarking different types data structures.
	Version 1.1 uses dynamic tables for testing computational complexity,
	as a time function of imported data quantities to the testing function.
	
	Data is generated as random integer numbers to new files. Size is imported
	from argument list (command prompt).
	
	Example of generated files during program action:

	Testing function does simple assignment - it multiplies random integer number
	from dynamic table by 2, than save it inside the same table.
	
	Example of generated output from program:
	(arguments list: 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 5000000 10000000 100000000)
